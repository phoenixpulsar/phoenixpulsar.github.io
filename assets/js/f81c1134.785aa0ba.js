Once a transaction is finalized and added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This immutability ensures transparency and trust within the blockchain system.\\n\\nHowever, not all data is stored in the blockchain itself. Smart contract state\u2014the data stored by a smart contract\u2014is managed differently. While the blockchain keeps a record of transactions that update this state, the actual state itself exists as part of the account\'s storage in NEAR.\\n\\nDeleting Contract State in NEAR\\n\\nIn NEAR, it is possible to delete a contract\'s state. When this happens:\\n\\nThe state associated with the contract is removed from the account storage.\\n\\nAny funds locked in the contract\'s storage are refunded to the account owner or a designated recipient.\\n\\nThe transaction that performed the deletion remains on the blockchain as an immutable record.\\n\\nThis process is intentional and designed for flexibility. For example, developers may choose to delete a contract after it is no longer needed or to redeploy a new version of the contract. The ability to clean up unused contracts helps manage storage costs, which are incurred for storing data on NEAR.\\n\\nDoes This Mean the Blockchain Isn\u2019t Permanent?\\n\\nNo, the blockchain\u2019s core immutability remains intact. The history of all transactions, including the one that deletes the contract state, is permanently recorded. What\u2019s being \\"deleted\\" is the state data stored for that specific account, not the record of its existence or the transactions associated with it.\\n\\nThis distinction is crucial: immutability applies to the blockchain\'s ledger, not necessarily to all the data managed by smart contracts.\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nTransactions and blocks are immutable and permanently recorded on the blockchain.\\n\\nSmart contract state can be deleted, but the transaction that triggered the deletion is permanently logged.\\n\\nDeleting contract state is a practical feature for managing costs and maintaining the system\u2019s efficiency.\\n\\nUnderstanding these nuances helped me appreciate the flexibility of NEAR\'s design while recognizing the underlying permanence of blockchain records. It\u2019s a balance between immutability for trust and adaptability for real-world use cases."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to my notes on technology.
