# About

This site was built with **[docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/)**.
Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (also called **[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)**).
It builds your site as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**.
I chose Docusaurus for its strong community, ease of customization, and built-in features that make it simple to organize and host _technical_ notes and _blog_ posts.

- Read the [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/)
