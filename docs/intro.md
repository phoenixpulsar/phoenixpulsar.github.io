# Running this Blog Intro

## Getting Started

This site was built with **[docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/)**.
Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (also called **[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)**).
It builds your site as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**.
I chose Docusaurus for its strong community, ease of customization, and built-in features that make it simple to organize and host technical notes and blog posts.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd blog
npm run start
```

Deploy to github:

```bash
USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Repo:
**[github](https://github.com/phoenixpulsar/phoenixpulsar.github.io)**.
